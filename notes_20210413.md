# Notes from Tyler/Dad Discussion - 4/13/21
- General 
  - Divide work into MVP and everything post-MVP
  - Mostly work on the MVP and keep a list of features only in the post-MVP
  - Site - StreamlitRainfall 
- Input Data
  - Most important, Tyler will try to get data closer to current (through 2018 at least was what we discussed.)
  - file naming convention first draft - country_district_municipality.csv.file 
  - content - two columns
    - Date - mm/dd/yyyy is preferable, but if it is 100% consistent, any convention is probably fine.
    - Rainfall Amount in Millimeters (for that Date)
  - we want all 3 districts for Kathmandu if possible, just the main 1 is our plan B.  In the later bucket, we will get other Nepal districts.
  - we will try to have Tyler's team assemble the data into the required format.  But if not, I can do that work - better work for Smart Paani for the short term for Nepal.
- Output data 
  - Use liters per day instead of tankers 
  - Focus on very good table output at the monthly level and a bit at the annual level.  The charts can take more of a back seat. 
  - Overflow data will become more important
- Desired Scenarios 
  - Average all years 
  - Worst Year 
  - Best Year 
  - Most Variable YearCalculation 
- Validation/Testing
  - I will prepare review materials for us to walkthrough the calculations next time we meet
- Some topics for the next time we meet:
  - Calculation Validation/Testing
  - Review changes from all the notes above
  - Big picture of licensing and selling and etc - initial discussion only
